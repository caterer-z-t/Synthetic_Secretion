        url: https://larremorelab.github.io/covid-calculator2
    description: It is well known that estimates of prevalence are directly affected by the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test being used. These calculators enable users to quickly compute Bayesian posteriors of prevalence, given field data and known sensitivity and specificity OR field data and lab validation data. This latter calculator recognizes the fact that sensitivity and specificity, themselves, are quantitites derived from data, and may thus be modeled jointly to estimate prevalence.

    description: Inspired in part by a study of university parental leave policies by Antecol et al. (New York Times, Inside HigherEd), we collected the paid parental leave policies for tenure-track faculty at 205 research universities in the US and Canada. The purpose of this post is to share the data we collected, highlight the complexity of many such policies, and share some preliminary analyses. Thanks to a tip from Laura Noren, we then obtained a dataset of paid parental leave policies for roughly 100 tech companies, crowdsourced by tech employees and community members after being started by Aaron Harnly of Amplify.
