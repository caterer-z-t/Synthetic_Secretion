<sup id="prestige-ranks">1</sup> A university's prestige rank is a measure of its ability to place its graduates as faculty at other prestigious universities. We use <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aar8260">SpringRank</a> to infer prestige hierarchies across academia _in toto_ and, separately, in each domain and field. In order for a university to have a prestige rank in a given field, it must employ faculty in that field and have trained at least one faculty member who is employed in that field.

<sup id="production-ranks">2</sup> A university's production rank is a measure of how many faculty it has trained. Production ranks are calculated for academia _in toto_ and, separately, for each domain and field. In order for a university to have a production rank in a given field, it must have trained at least one faculty member who is employed in that field.
