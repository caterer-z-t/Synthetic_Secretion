# Research Focus

## Summary
Our research aims to develop a computational model that simulates the interactions between beta and delta cells within pancreatic islets. By integrating gap junctional coupling into the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model, we seek to understand how electrical and biochemical signaling influences hormone secretion, beta cell synchronization, and delta cell heterogeneity. Our approach combines computational modeling with experimental data to refine predictions about cellular behavior, ultimately improving our understanding of islet function and its role in metabolic regulation.

## Goals

- **Develop a Scalable Islet Model** – Create a computationally efficient yet biologically relevant model that simulates interactions among beta and delta cells.

- **Implement Electrical Coupling Mechanisms** – Investigate how gap junction strength influences beta cell synchronization and delta cell heterogeneity.

- **Refine Hormone Secretion Modeling** – Establish calcium-dependent secretion dynamics to better simulate physiological exocytosis.

- **Integrate Experimental Data** – Validate computational predictions using experimental results from ongoing research.

- **Enhance Model Visualization** – Generate graphical and animated outputs to facilitate analysis and interpretation of simulation results.
