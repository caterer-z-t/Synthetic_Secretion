# Interdisciplinary Quantitative (IQ) Biology Team Rotation

## Overview
The [**IQ Biology** (Interdisciplinary Quantitative Biology) PhD program](https://www.colorado.edu/certificate/iqbiology/) at the [**University of Colorado Boulder**](https://www.colorado.edu/) is designed to train students at the intersection of biology, computation, and quantitative analysis. The program fosters interdisciplinary collaboration by integrating methods from multiple scientific domains to address complex biological questions. 

### Key Features:
- **Interdisciplinary Training**: Students gain expertise across biology, mathematics, engineering, and computer science.
- **Collaborative Research**: Participants work with multiple faculty members across departments.
- **Rotations and Team Projects**: Exposure to diverse research environments through lab rotations and team-based projects.
- **Professional Development**: Emphasis on communication, leadership, and interdisciplinary problem-solving skills.

## IQ Biology Team Project
### Purpose
The **IQ Biology Team Rotation** challenges interdisciplinary teams to develop innovative research projects that integrate expertise from different scientific disciplines. Rather than focusing on a specific biological system, the goal is to cultivate novel approaches to scientific problems through interdisciplinary collaboration.

### Objectives
- Synthesize analytical, computational, and biological knowledge to tackle interdisciplinary research questions.
- Develop new conceptual frameworks or apply existing tools in novel ways.
- Critically evaluate the strengths and limitations of an interdisciplinary research topic.
- Foster effective teamwork and collaboration across scientific disciplines.
- Communicate research findings to both specialists and general audiences.
- Establish new partnerships and foster innovative ideas across departments.

### Structure and Expectations
#### Team Formation
- Teams (typically) consist of **three members**, each bringing expertise from different disciplines.
- The project should integrate knowledge from **at least two different research laboratories**, preferably from different departments.

#### Faculty Involvement
- **Two (or more) faculty advisors** guide the early project development.
- Only one faculty member is required as a primary advisor to meet with the team weekly.
- Faculty **do not provide a fully formed project** but may offer data, ideas, or research directions.

#### Research Project Ownership
- Teams **own the project** and are responsible for its development, execution, and presentation.
- Faculty serve as mentors, providing guidance but not direct project management.

#### Timeline Highlights (Spring 2025)
- **Feb 28**: Finalize rotation advisors and team members.
- **March 3**: Begin weekly meetings with advisors; develop research plan.
- **April 1**: Submit a progress summary and management plan.
- **May 19**: Submit a **Team Rotation preprint** for review and potential publication.

#### Final Presentation
- Teams will present a **20-minute talk** covering their project and reflections on teamwork.
- Every team member must contribute to both research and presentation.
- The presentation will be attended by **peers, faculty mentors, and research groups**.

## Conclusion
The IQ Biology Team Project embodies the core philosophy of interdisciplinary research: integrating diverse knowledge to develop innovative solutions. Through collaboration, students gain hands-on experience in navigating scientific challenges that require a **multi-faceted** approach, preparing them for careers at the intersection of biology and quantitative sciences.
